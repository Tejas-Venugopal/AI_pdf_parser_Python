The issue lies in the summarization process. The summarizer seems to focus heavily on the most emphasized details in the text, possibly omitting or downplaying other projects. To address this and get a more complete answer, let's adjust the code and approach:

Key Adjustments
Disable Summarization for QA Input: Summarization might over-simplify the context, removing important details. For shorter contexts (like your resume), directly pass the original text to the QA pipeline.

Use a More Context-Preserving Summarization: If summarization is necessary, increase the maximum length to retain all relevant details.

Extract Multiple Answers: To ensure all projects are captured, extract answers iteratively using specific questions for each type of project.
